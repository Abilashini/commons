<!-- Instructions -->
<!-- 1. Deploy jaxrs_basic.war in WSO2 Application Server (sample service has been modified to return json response for all POST requests)
     2. Deploy this proxy service in ESB
     3. Send the following JSON request to ESB proxy service - I used soapUI
{
  "Customer": { "name": "charitha" }
}

4. Client should receive something similar to the following
{"Customer": {
   "id": "128",
   "name": "charitha"
}}

   <proxy name="jsonproxy"
          transports="https http"
          startOnLoad="true"
          trace="disable">
      <target>
         <endpoint>
            <address uri="http://localhost:9769/jaxrs_basic/services/customers/customerservice/customers"/>
         </endpoint>
         <outSequence>
