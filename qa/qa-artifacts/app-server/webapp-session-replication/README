How to test webapp session replication
--------------------------------------

1. Deploy the HelloWorldWebapp.war & let it sync to worker nodes (This webapp has a System out which will be printed when the webapp URL is accessed. So when testing this, do NOT start the server with nohup, start it by just giving the command ./wso2server.sh. Else it would not print the Sysout)

2. Using the below curl commands to verify whether the session gets replicated

storing cookie in  file when accessing - 
$ curl --cookie-jar ./tempfile http://192.168.4.54:9763/HelloWorldWebapp/


using that cookie to access second url
$ curl --cookie ./tempfile http://192.168.4.54:9763/HelloWorldWebapp/
