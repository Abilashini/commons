2. If you are using Linux, use the war attached in this folder. fileUploadSample.war

3. If you use linux and fileUploadSample.war, you can use the html web page or soap. 

To use Soap enter, http://localhost:9763/fileUploadSample/UploadServlet

To use via the form, Click go to URl, it will direct to the http://192.168.94.1:9763/fileUploadSample/ web form. If you use a web form, use a tcp mon to view the header values and change the ports in the index.jsp form action="http://localhost:9763/fileUploadSample/UploadServlet".

3. Source code is also available if you need to do any changes in fileUploadSample folder.

4. This war will be the backend which should be deployed in the AS you are going to test.

   You can view the content type which you send via your request and which will be accepted by your backend using tcp mon or soap raw value

5. You can edit the source code as you can manipulate the request data in the AS and build the source and create a war and deploy it again.
