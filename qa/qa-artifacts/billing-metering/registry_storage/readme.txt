 -each txt file in this directory is of the size mentioned by its name. NOTE: Stratos default setup doesn't let you add files >=10MB at once.

- datecp can be used to add a date tag to the files and use various versions of the same file to registry since the registry doesn't let you add the same file to the same location more than once.
sh datecp ../Documents/Stratos/testdata/6MB.txt will give;  6MB-2011-10-13_14.3621.txt
