Step to run the test
--------------------
1. Deploy the synapse.xml
2. Start the backend server which you need to talk to (E.g.:- WSAS/SimpleAxis2Server)
3. Invoke the client using the following commands

If you are using the ESB sample client

ant stockquote -Dtrpurl=http://localhost:8280/ 

If you are using a Javabench/Curl client

java -jar benchmark.jar -p StockQuoteRequest.xml -n 1 -c 1 -k -H "SOAPAction: urn:getQuote" -H "Content-Type:text/xml; charset=UTF-8"  http://localhost:8280/

NOTE: StockQuoteRequest.xml is located at https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/commons/qa/component-test-framework/test-resources/request-xmls
