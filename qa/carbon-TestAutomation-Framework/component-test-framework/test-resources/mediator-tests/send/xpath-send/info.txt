Step to run the test
--------------------
1. Deploy the synapse.xml
2. Create an endpoint (by the name echoEpr) in the config registry under the path /repository/endpoints (E.g.:- /_system/config/repository/endpoints/echoEpr)
2. Start the backend server which you need to talk to 
3. Invoke the client using the following command

If you are using a Javabench/Curl client

java -jar benchmark.jar -p echoString.xml -n 1 -c 1 -k -H "SOAPAction: urn:echoString" -H "Content-Type:text/xml; charset=UTF-8"  http://localhost:8280/

NOTE: echoString.xml is located at https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/commons/qa/component-test-framework/test-resources/request-xmls
