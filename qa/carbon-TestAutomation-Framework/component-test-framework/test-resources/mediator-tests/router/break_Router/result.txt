If breakRouter="false" then text = ##########SECOND ROUTE######## and text = =============THIRD ROUTE============= should be logged since the message goes through it's sibling Router mediators

If it's set to false, it should NOT invoke it's sibling Router mediators and the above logs should not be printed
