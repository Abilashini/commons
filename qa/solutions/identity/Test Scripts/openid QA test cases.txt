Claim Mappings
--------------

Few stps as a workaround for a defect
- Add a new claim (put under Dialect URI: http://axschema.org)
- Enable supporting (switch it on)
- From idp create a new user with data added to the new claim
- Come back to IS admin, go to claim mappings and map the claim with the claim value


- Go to idp and edit an existing profile to add a value to the claim that was just added
- Open openidaxsubmit.jsp
- Add the new claim to the 'if' clause
 openIDAuthRequest.addRequiredClaims(hobby","http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/hobby");              	
                  }

- Open openidloggedin.jsp
Add the new claim
			<% if (request.getAttribute("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/hobby") != null) { %>
			<tr>
				<td>Hobby:</td>
				<td><%=request.getAttribute("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/hobby")%></td>
