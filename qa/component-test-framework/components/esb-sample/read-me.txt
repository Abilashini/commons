before running the esb-samples
deploy ESB
    add ESB_HOME to carbon.home in the component-test-framework/config/framework.properties
    e.g.
        for linux
        ----------
        carbon.home = /home/suho/proj/wso2/esb/wso2esb

        for windows
        ------------
        carbon.home = C:\\Documents and Settings\\proj\\wso2\\esb\\wso2esb\\

To run sample100 and sample153
    Download and install the unlimited strength policy files for your JDK  ( see http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp)

Add the necessary services to the axis2server. To add this,
    run 'ant' command from the directories
        ESB_HOME/samples/axis2Server/src/FastStockQuoteService
        ESB_HOME/samples/axis2Server/src/ReliableStockQuoteService
        ESB_HOME/samples/axis2Server/src/SecureStockQuoteService
        ESB_HOME/samples/axis2Server/src/MTOMSwASampleService
        ESB_HOME/samples/axis2Server/src/SimpleStockQuoteService

Start the axis2server on port 9000 (with default configurations)
Start ESB with default configurations

Run the esb-samples
    run "mvn clean install" from directory
    component-test-framework/authenticator/
    component-test-framework/common/
    component-test-framework/synapse-config-admin/
     component-test-framework/test-setup-config
    and then run "mvn clean install" from directory component-test-framework/esb-sample/
