Spring Service
==============

This test application verifies the spring bean handling capability of WSO2 WSAS. 
Two spring beans are included in the service archive. 
-EchoBean
-PersonBean

Run 'ant run.client1' to invoke the EchoBean.
Run 'ant run.client2' to invoke the PersonBean.

Running the testcase does not validate the UI level spring handling. 
Therefore, it is always recommended to repeat the same scenario using WSAS management console.
