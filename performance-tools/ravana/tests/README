In this README I assume PERFTET_HOME is where Ravana unarchived.
These tests are designed to automate the performance tests.
The normal way of doing a performance test is by placing a required config.xml file in conf folder
and then from RAVANA_HOME run 
perl Test.pl

This is great. However when you have to organize different tests, the best thing is to write a simple script and organize tests
in a folder. Each test folder here do that purpose.

Suppose for example you need to performance test WSO2 ESB 3.0.1 for direct proxy scenario. In order to organize your test scenario you
can follow the steps below.
Steps
-----

1. Create the scenario folder which contain the messages you want to test in the scenario folder naming it as wso2esb-3.0.1_pass
2. create a folder called wso2esb-3.0.1_pass inside tests folder.
3. Create config_<messagesize>.xml and test<messagesize>.sh for each message size. In the config files give the appropriate
   values for parameters. In the test files do the required handling of the test. Note that these test scripts are supposed
   to be run from RAVANA_HOME folder.
4. Copy each test script from the corresponding test folder to the RAVANA_HOME folder and run them.

In the each test folder in RAVANA_HOME/tests, scripts are provided to run that test scenario. In each scenario folder in 
RAVANA_HOME/scenario the messages for the test scenario with the same name, is provided.
